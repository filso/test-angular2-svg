# TestAngular2Svg

I used present code for SVG. I prefer to take something working when possible and use saved time to improve it, rather than reinvent the wheel.

I chose Angular 2 because I'm still new to it. Generator scaffolds with Webpack and tests. I know Angular 1.x inside out, having worked with it since early beta versions.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
